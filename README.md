Intro to Sklearn
========
This program is intended for an application to HackerSchoool.  It was origionally a project for myself to learn how to use the Sklearn libraries, Twitter API, RegEx library, and Flask.

There are three data pages produced  
1) Comparison of cross-validation scores across varying sample sizes  
2) Comparison of cross-validation scores across varying sample topics  
3) Predict whether a sentence belongs in a topic  


Run this code
```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt  

python webapp.py
```

Use the following three addresses to view data:  
1) localhost:5000/training_size  
2) localhost:5000/tweet_topic  
3) localhost:5000/predict
