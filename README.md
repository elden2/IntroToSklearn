This program is intended for an application to HackerSchoool.  It was origionally a project for myself to learn how to use the Sklearn libraries, Twitter API, and Flask.

There are three data pages produced.
1) Comparison of cross-validation scores across varying sample sizes
2) Comparison of cross-validation scores across varying sample topics
3) Predict whether a sentence belongs in a topic
